Flow Constraints Map
This repository hosts an interactive map visualizing flow constraints for various dams. The map provides essential data on reservoir levels, releases, river flow, and other operational constraints, making it a useful tool for researchers, engineers, and decision-makers.

📌 Features
Interactive Markers: Each dam location is marked on the map.
Detailed Popups: View key constraint data such as:
Reservoir Level Constraints
Release Constraints
River Flow Constraints
Ramping and Logical Constraints
Source Links for further details.
User-Friendly Interface: Easily explore and interact with the data.
🛠️ Technology Stack
Python: Data processing and map generation.
Folium: Creation of interactive maps.
Pandas: Handling and analyzing tabular data.
GitHub Pages: Hosting the live map.
📂 Repository Files
index.html: The main file that renders the map on GitHub Pages.
README.md: Documentation for this repository.
🚀 How to Use
Visit the live map.
Explore the map by clicking on dam markers.
